# Who Wants to Be a Homework Free: Macbeth Edition

## Overview
This interactive quiz game is inspired by the classic game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," tailored specifically for students engaged in history and English workshops. The game tests players' knowledge of Shakespeare's *Macbeth* through a series of questions, allowing them to earn points and enjoy a fun learning experience.

### JavaScript

I used ManageEngine's JavaScript Validator to check my code. The errors reported were related to the JavaScript version I used:

- **Line 23, Column 1:** `'const'` is available in ES6 (use `'esversion: 6'`) or Mozilla JS extensions (use `moz`).
- **Line 29, Column 35:** Arrow function syntax (`=>`) is only available in ES6 (use `'esversion: 6'`).

I believe these issues are due to a misconfiguration of the linter tool.
